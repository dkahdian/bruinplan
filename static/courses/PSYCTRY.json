        "description": "(Formerly numbered 188.) Lecture, three hours. Our brains bias our behaviors to optimize functioning in our environment but often based on premises that are contrary to society goals of equality. Biases, both implicit and explicit are prevalent, and their existence leads to both overt and covert decision-making based on race, financial status, gender, and disabilities. Focus on biases, inequities, and disparities that surround mental health. Exploration of relevant biases in society and how they may arise. Students learn about implicit and explicit bias, and discuss instruments attempting to measure biases including implicit-association test. Exploration of multiple areas related to structural racism and how it contributes to mental health inequities. Review of biases against those with mental health disorders, exacerbation of mental health disorders, health inequities because of racism and discrimination, and treatment biases for mental health disorders. Consideration of current and historical research and relevance of public policies and criminal justice system in creating and perpetuating health inequities. P/NP or letter grading.",
