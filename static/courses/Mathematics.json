The MPT determines the mathematics course in which you will have the greatest success. ALEKS PPL is a web-based program that uses artificial intelligence to map a student’s strengths and weaknesses. The assessment is up to 30 questions and generally takes 60-90 minutes to complete. After the assessment, an individualized Prep and Learning Module is available for students to refresh their knowledge on forgotten topics. Students then have the opportunity to reassess and improve their placement.",
