Conservation genetics is interdisciplinary field that integrates genetic methods and concepts from population genetics, evolutionary biology, molecular ecology, and systematics to understand how to conserve and manage populations and species of natural organisms, and understand genetic processes underlying why some go extinct. Case studies of plants and animals cover range of topics including habitat loss, population size, and inbreeding depression; landscape change and genetic connectivity of populations; climate change and local adaptation; management of wild and natural populations; and invasive species.

Intermediate linear and nonlinear control system, multicompartmental, epidemiological, pharmacokinetic, and other biomodeling methods applied to life sciences problems at molecular, cellular, organ, and population levels. Both theory- and data-driven modeling, with focus on translating biomodeling goals and data into dynamical mathematical models, and implementing them for simulation, quantification, and analysis. Numerical simulation, optimization, and parameter identifiability and search algorithms, with model discrimination and analysis and software exercises in PC laboratory assignments. Letter grading.",
