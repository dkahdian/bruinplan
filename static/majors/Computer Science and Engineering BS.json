  "name": "Computer Science and Engineering BS",
  "overview": "The Computer Science and Engineering curriculum at UCLA provides students with the education and training necessary to design, implement, test, and utilize the hardware and software of digital computers and digital systems. The curriculum has components spanning both the Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering departments. The curriculum covers all aspects of computer systems from electronic design through logic design, MSI, LSI, and VLSI concepts; device utilization, machine language design, implementation and programming, operating system concepts, systems programming, networking fundamentals, and higher-level language skills; and their application. Students are prepared for employment in a wide spectrum of high-technology industries. The computer science and engineering program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission and the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.",
