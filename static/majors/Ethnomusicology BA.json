  "name": "Ethnomusicology BA",
  "overview": "The undergraduate major in Ethnomusicology emphasizes general world music, performance/composition, public ethnomusicology, and scholarly research. The major provides students with a wide-ranging liberal arts education in music. At its core, this includes (1) comprehensive knowledge of music cultures of the world; (2) understanding of the interrelationship of music, society, and culture; (3) grounding in the basics of global music theory and musicianship; and (4) the experience of playing in one or several musical ensembles from various traditions around the world.\n\nBeyond the core and emphasis requirements, students may, through elective courses, prepare for a variety of career goals, including the study of ethnomusicology in graduate school, composing and performing music, working in the music industry, serving society in the nonprofit sector, or becoming a K through 12 music teacher.\n\nThe Ethnomusicology major is a designated capstone major. The capstone project is individualized to each student and requires a creative process either through music performance/composition, a research project, or an internship with a self-reflective journal detailing the process. Through that process, students are expected to demonstrate a broad knowledge base and competency in performance, writing, and/or composition and ability to apply knowledge and experience to the specific requirements of the capstone; conceive and successfully complete a project that is expressive of their specific interests and acquired expertise; and display, through written documentation or live presentation, the requisite communication and, in some cases, teamwork required by work in this field.",
