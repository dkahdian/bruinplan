  "name": "World Arts and Cultures BA",
  "overview": "The World Arts and Culture major emphasizes a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary approach to the study of art making, community engagement, and multimedia analysis. The five required preparation for the major courses introduce students to the intersectionality evidenced in the collective work of the faculty. A lower-division, practice-based course enables students to connect the practice and study of art-making across a variety of genres and forms. In three lower-division seminars, students are prepared for the major by studying theoretical concepts of culture, the tensions between local and global art perception, and the diverse ways that colonialism has been understood and resisted around the globe.",
