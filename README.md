# BruinPlan

A modern, interactive course planning tool for UCLA students â€” designed to provide a better alternative to the traditional DARS interface. This static site visualizes course requirements, prerequisites, and scheduling paths to make degree planning intuitive and personalized.

---

## Project Overview

UCLA's current Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS) provides dense, hard-to-interpret data. This project aims to reimagine that experience with a visual and interactive frontend tool that allows students to:

- View **required courses**, **electives**, and **degree progress** by major
- Explore **prerequisite trees** in an interactive graph
- Filter and sort courses by **department**, **availability**, **professor**, and more
- Track completed courses and see valid paths toward graduation
- Build quarter-by-quarter **course plans**
- View rich metadata:
  - Grading distributions (via UCLAGrades)
  - Professor reviews (via Bruinwalk)
  - Course availability and scheduling

## Data Sourcing & Technical Approach

### Course & Major Data Collection
- **Data Source**: UCLA course catalog and degree requirements (publicly available online)
- **Collection Method**: 
  - Selenium scripts to extract raw data from UCLA systems
  - AI-assisted parsing to convert raw data into structured JSON format
  - Automated testing to ensure format consistency and data integrity
- **Update Strategy**: Quarterly update scripts to maintain current course information

### Course Planning System
- **Planning Logic**: Enhanced completion tracking with quarter assignments
  - Current: Binary completed/not completed status
  - Planned: Quarter-specific assignments (e.g., 125 â†’ Winter 2025, 327 â†’ Summer 2027, 0 â†’ completed)
- **Prerequisite Validation**: Smart checking to ensure prerequisites are planned in logical order
- **Interface**: Quarter-by-quarter calendar sidebar on major pages

### Quarter-Based Planning System

The planning interface will evolve from the current binary completion tracking to a sophisticated quarter assignment system:

**Current System:**
- Binary status: completed vs. not completed
- Stored in localStorage as a simple Set

**Planned System:**
- Quarter-specific assignments with numeric codes:
  - `125` â†’ Winter 2025
  - `327` â†’ Summer 2027  
  - `0` â†’ Completed (already taken)
- **Smart Validation**: Automatic checking to ensure prerequisites are scheduled before dependent courses
- **Visual Calendar**: Quarter-by-quarter sidebar on major pages showing planned course sequence
- **Prerequisite Warnings**: Alert users when course scheduling violates prerequisite order

This approach maintains the static site architecture while providing sophisticated academic planning capabilities.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Static Site Hosting**: GitHub Pages for free, reliable hosting
- **No Backend Required**: LocalStorage for user data persistence
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to remain static while supporting advanced features
