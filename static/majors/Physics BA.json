  "name": "Physics BA",
  "overview": "The Physics BA major is intended to provide students with a strong background in physics, yet allow students flexibility to study other fields as well. It should be of particular interest to students who want to double major or who want to teach science. Students who intend to continue work toward the PhD in Physics are advised to pursue the Physics BS.\n\nA detailed brochure on the major is available from the Undergraduate Office, 1-707A Physics and Astronomy Building.\n\n### Learning Outcomes\n1.  Ability to apply knowledge of classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and thermal physics to understand and analyze a broad variety of physical phenomena.\n2.  Application and improvement of proficiency in mathematics skills in calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra.\n3.  Ability to critically analyze and interpret data in order to draw valid scientific conclusions.\n4.  Ability to present clear written and oral accounts of scientific results.\n5.  Scientific, mathematical, computing, and laboratory skills that enable pursuit of career objectives in graduate or professional schools, in a teaching career, or in a scientific career in government or industry.\n\n### Entry to the Major\nTransfer applicants to the Physics BA major with 90 or more units must complete the following introductory courses prior to admission to UCLA: two years of calculus, one and one half years of calculus-based physics with laboratory for majors, and one general chemistry course for majors.\n\nRefer to the UCLA transfer admission guide for up-to-date information regarding transfer selection for admission.",
