  "name": "Art History BA",
  "overview": "The Art History major is a designated capstone program. Through their capstone work, students are expected to conceive and execute a research or creative project; identify and evaluate documentation relevant to the discipline; develop an enhanced capacity for writing and research, critical and analytical thinking, and competent familiarity with art historical methodologies; and identify and articulate these arguments within art historical discourse and areas of specialization. The capstone experience also enables students to develop an enriched understanding of the foundations of the discipline, as well as the current landscape of the field.",
