Focus on quantifying how tectonic and surface processes interact to govern landscape evolution. How landscapes can provide insights into physical and chemical surface processes, including bedrock weathering, soil formation, hillslope transport, and river and glacial erosion. How tectonics, climate, and underlying lithology may influence those processes in landscapes. Concurrently scheduled with course C166. S/U or letter grading.",
