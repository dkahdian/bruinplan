  "name": "Business Economics BA",
  "overview": "The Business Economics BA program offers a major for students seeking a business orientation in their study of economics. It does not replicate the traditional undergraduate business school curriculum. Instead, it offers a more tightly focused curriculum that is guided by the rigorous logic and integrative perspective of economics. It is designed to prepare students for graduate education in business, economics, and law. The program requires students to include specific courses offered by the department and the John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management.",

      "description": "Admission\nApplications for admission by current UCLA students are handled exclusively by the Department of Economics. To apply, students must have completed at least one 12-unit term at UCLA in a regular session and all courses listed under preparation for the major. Students must apply no later than the end of the 8th regular quarter at UCLA. Final grades for all major preparation courses must be reflected on the degree audit report prior to submission. Applications are available on the undergraduate economics Bruin Learn website and are accepted online during the first three weeks of each quarter as well as summer session A.\n\nIn addition, they must have a minimum grade of a C or higher in each preparation course, have a minimum 3.0 grade-point average in all preparation courses, have a minimum 2.0 (C) grade-point average in their upper-division courses taken for the major before applying (Economics 101 applies on the major preparation grade-point average), and meet the primary score for the major. The requisite grade-point averages plus completion of the preparation for the major courses do not guarantee admission to the program.\n\nPre-Major\nWhile students are completing the preparation courses for the major, they may be classified as Business Economics pre-majors.\n\nTransfer Students\nTransfer students must be admitted to UCLA as an Economics pre-major or Business Economics pre-major in order to pursue either major. Transfer applicants to the Business Economics major must complete the following introductory courses prior to admission to UCLA: one microeconomics course, one macroeconomics course, two calculus courses from the mathematics/physical sciences sequence. Transfer credit is subject to department approval; consult with an undergraduate counselor before enrolling in any courses for the major.",
