  "name": "Russian Language and Literature BA",
  "overview": "The Russian Language and Literature major is designed to provide students with basic mastery of the Russian language and familiarity with the classics of Russian literature. Students typically begin to study Russian in their first year, but those contemplating a Russian major later in their academic program can fulfill the Russian language requirement by combining regular coursework with summer programs or with the University of California Education Abroad Program (EAP) in Moscow, which is open to students who have completed the equivalent of one or more years of study (level 1 on the American Council on Teaching of Foreign Languages [ACTFL] scale). Students interested in this program should consult with the undergraduate adviser as early as possible.",
