  "name": "Electrical Engineering BS",
  "overview": "The undergraduate curriculum provides all Electrical Engineering majors with preparation in the mathematical and scientific disciplines that lead to a set of courses that span the fundamentals of the three major departmental areas of signals and systems, circuits and embedded systems, and physical wave electronics. These collectively provide an understanding of inventions of importance to society, such as integrated circuits, embedded systems, photonic devices, automatic computation and control, and telecommunication devices and systems.\n\nStudents are encouraged to make use of their electrical engineering electives and a two-term capstone design course to pursue deeper knowledge within one of these areas according to their interests, whether for graduate study or preparation for employment. See the department website for examples of specializations.\n\nThe Electrical Engineering major is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.\n\nThe Electrical Engineering major is a designated capstone major. Undergraduate students complete a design course in which they integrate their knowledge of the discipline and engage in creative design within realistic and professional constraints. Students apply their knowledge and expertise gained in previous mathematics, science, and engineering coursework. Within a multidisciplinary team structure, students identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems and present their projects to the class.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n1. Application of knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.\n2. Design of a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints.\n3. Function as a productive member of a multidisciplinary team.\n4. Effective communication.\n5. Identification, formulation, and solution of electrical engineering problems.",
