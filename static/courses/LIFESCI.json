Examination of health disparities and ways in which societal responses to race and ethnicity in combination with variety of other factors create differential quality and access to healthcare resulting in poor health outcomes in racial/ethnic minorities. Basic foundation for critical thinking about assumptions that shape life sciences, medical research, clinical practice, and social and behavioral sciences as they relate to racial and ethnic minority populations and to teach students to integrate concepts of culture and health disparities into other social, biological, political, psychological, genetic, and clinical health interests.
