  "name": "Design Media Arts BA",
  "overview": "The undergraduate program begins with the study of basic design elements and processes: form, color, drawing, letterforms and typography, motion, and interactivity. Historical perspectives and social issues are also introduced. At the upper-division level, studio courses explore current uses of interactive media and new directions in visual communication design, including the study of time and motion, as well as virtual form and space in computer-generated environments. Through a balance of courses in theory, criticism, and practice, students develop an understanding of design principles. Most courses are taught as studios of no more than 22 students, which encourages individual growth and fosters a sense of community within the department. The Design | Media Arts major is a designated capstone major. Students are required to complete an advanced project of their own that entails full engagement with the design process. Through their capstone work, students demonstrate their capacities for research, ideation/concept development, creative and design direction, communication strategy, design, production/fabrication, and critical analysis. Capstone courses focus on career choice, and final projects are showcased at the spring senior show.",
