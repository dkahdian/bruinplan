# BruinPlan

A modern, interactive course planning tool for UCLA students â€” designed to provide a better alternative to the traditional DARS interface. This static site visualizes course requirements, prerequisites, and scheduling paths to make degree planning intuitive and personalized.

---

## Project Overview

UCLA's current Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS) provides dense, hard-to-interpret data. This project reimagines that experience with a modern, visual, and interactive frontend tool that allows students to:

- **Visualize course prerequisites** in interactive graphs with smooth animations
- **Explore major requirements** through organized sectioned layouts
- **Track degree progress** with intelligent completion tracking
- **Navigate complex dependencies** between courses and requirements
- **Plan course sequences** with prerequisite validation and drag-and-drop scheduling
- **Filter and explore** courses by department and completion status
- **Experience smooth interactions** with always-on animations and incremental updates

**Key Innovation**: Advanced graph visualization using Cytoscape.js with sophisticated prerequisite logic, equivalent course handling, and dynamic group satisfaction algorithms combined with intuitive drag-and-drop quarter planning.

## Technical Architecture

### Graph Visualization System
- **Cytoscape.js**: Core graph rendering with Dagre layout algorithm
- **Smooth Animations**: Always-on positional animations for enhanced user experience
- **Incremental Updates**: Efficient graph updates that only modify changed nodes/edges
- **Compound Nodes**: Support for sectioned layouts in major graphs
- **Advanced Styling**: Dynamic node/edge styling based on completion status and prerequisite types

### Prerequisite Logic Engine
- **Diamond Group Satisfaction**: Sophisticated "choose N from M" requirement handling
- **Equivalent Course Support**: Smart prerequisite satisfaction with alternative courses
- **Recursive Prerequisite Resolution**: Automatic inclusion of missing prerequisites
- **Completion-Aware Traversal**: Dynamic graph building based on user completion status

### Quarter Planning System
- **Drag-and-Drop Scheduling**: Intuitive course assignment to quarters
- **Prerequisite Validation**: Smart checking to ensure logical course sequences
- **Progress Tracking**: Dual-colored progress bars showing completed and planned courses
- **Quarter Management**: Flexible quarter range with add/remove functionality

### Data Management
- **JSON-Based Course Database**: Structured course and major requirement data
  - Courses are now split into 168 per-subject files: `static/courses/[SUBJECT].json`
  - Each file is a JSON array of course objects (not an object with a `courses` array)
  - `equivalentCourses` is always an empty array for now (future support planned)
- **localStorage Persistence**: Client-side completion tracking without backend
- **Svelte Stores**: Reactive state management for completion status
- **TypeScript Type Safety**: Comprehensive type definitions for all data structures

### Component Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components for graphs, sidebars, and controls
- **Service Layer**: Separate business logic from UI components
- **Event-Driven**: Reactive updates throughout the application
- **Accessibility-First**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

## Data Sourcing & Technical Approach

### Course & Major Data Collection
- **Data Source**: UCLA course catalog and degree requirements (publicly available online)
- **Collection Method**: 
  - Selenium scripts to extract raw data from UCLA systems
  - AI-assisted parsing to convert raw data into structured JSON format
  - Automated testing to ensure format consistency and data integrity
- **Update Strategy**: Quarterly update scripts to maintain current course information

### Course Planning System
- **Planning Logic**: Enhanced completion tracking with quarter assignments
  - Current: Binary completed/not completed status
  - Planned: Quarter-specific assignments (e.g., 125 â†’ Winter 2025, 327 â†’ Summer 2027, 0 â†’ completed)
- **Prerequisite Validation**: Smart checking to ensure prerequisites are planned in logical order
- **Interface**: Quarter-by-quarter calendar sidebar on major pages

### Quarter-Based Planning System

The planning interface will evolve from the current binary completion tracking to a sophisticated quarter assignment system:

**Current System:**
- Binary status: completed vs. not completed
- Stored in localStorage as a simple Set

**Planned System:**
- Quarter-specific assignments with numeric codes:
  - `125` â†’ Winter 2025
  - `327` â†’ Summer 2027  
  - `0` â†’ Completed (already taken)
- **Smart Validation**: Automatic checking to ensure prerequisites are scheduled before dependent courses
- **Visual Calendar**: Quarter-by-quarter sidebar on major pages showing planned course sequence
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive course scheduling by dragging from requirements to quarters
- **Prerequisite Warnings**: Alert users when course scheduling violates prerequisite order

This approach maintains the static site architecture while providing sophisticated academic planning capabilities.

**ðŸ“‹ Detailed Specification**: See `quarter-planning-spec.md` for complete implementation details including data structures, validation rules, and UI components.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Static Site Hosting**: GitHub Pages for free, reliable hosting
- **No Backend Required**: LocalStorage for user data persistence
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to remain static while supporting advanced features
