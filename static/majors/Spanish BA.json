  "name": "Spanish BA",
  "overview": "The Spanish major is a designated capstone major. Seniors complete a capstone seminar that provides a unique opportunity to work closely with a faculty member on a focused topic of research. Through their capstone work, students are expected to demonstrate mastery of the Spanish language, along with specific skills and expertise acquired in earlier coursework. Additionally, students acquire a working knowledge of scholarly discourse relative to a specialized topic, conceive and execute an associated project, and engage with a community of scholars, presenting their work to peers and helping to further peers’ work through discussion and critique.",
