  "name": "Linguistics BA",
  "overview": "Linguistics is the scientific study of languages as a general phenomenon. It aims to help answer broad questions concerning the nature of human cognition and communication. Students will learn about language universals as well as the ways in which languages differ from one another in terms of their sound patterns, syntax, and the way they encode meaning. They will also learn about the linguistic theories explaining and constraining linguistic knowledge, informed in part by experimental investigations of child language acquisition and adult language processing. Successful graduates will receive a cognitive science education with a focus on language; they will develop skills in data analysis, analytic reasoning, and experimental methods.",
