  "name": "Nordic Studies BA",
  "overview": "The Nordic Studies major is a designated capstone major. Under the guidance of faculty members, students are required to devise, research, and complete either a substantial research paper, film/video, or a website that reflects significant engagement with a challenging question in the realm of Nordic studies. Through their capstone work, all students are expected to demonstrate their skills in articulating a clear and sophisticated research question, devising a realizable set of research goals, deploy their advanced knowledge of a Nordic language to access target language research materials and incorporate them into the research corpus, devise an appropriate modality for the final project, present a concise engaging public presentation of their research and respond to questions, and archive their project in an appropriate form.",
