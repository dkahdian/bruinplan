The examination score is used to determine eligibility and placement in first-year music core courses (Music M6A, M6B, M6C, and 20A, 20B, 20C, or 21A, 21B, 21C). Examination results may require enrollment in Music 3 as a requisite to both courses M6A and 20A/21A. Entering transfer students must also take the examination to determine placement.\n\nRecitals\nAll recitals are videotaped and archived; performances are evaluated by a jury.\n\nStrings Ensemble Substitution\nFor classical guitar, harp, and string bass, students may petition to substitute alternative courses if there are no suitable chamber ensembles offered during the academic year. For classical guitar, students may petition to substitute Music C185A, C185B, or appropriate ethnomusicology ensembles.",
