  "name": "Mathematics Applied Science BS",
  "overview": "The Mathematics/Applied Science major is designed for students with a substantial interest in mathematics and its applications to a particular field. It is an individual major in that students, in consultation with a faculty adviser, design their own program. They may also select one of the established programs: mathematics/history of science plan or medical and life sciences plan. In the past, Mathematics/Applied Science majors have combined the study of mathematics with fields such as atmospheric and oceanic sciences, biochemistry, biology, chemistry, economics, geography, physics, psychology, and statistics.",
