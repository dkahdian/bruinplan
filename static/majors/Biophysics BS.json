  "name": "Biophysics BS",
  "overview": "The goal of the Biophysics major is to provide students with an undergraduate background that will enable them to enter competitive graduate programs in biophysics, molecular biology, and biological physics. It also aims at providing students with a solid, quantitative background for careers in the medical field of the future as well as in molecular biology, neuroscience, and biological physics which are all emerging as important and rapidly developing areas of physics. The major is designed to provide students with a flexible scientific/technical training that allows them to explore these different career paths and tailor their class work to their scientific interests. The program aims at providing an opportunity to the students to become scientific leaders, bringing the analytic and experimental techniques of different fields to bear on the fascinating world of the physics of living systems.",
