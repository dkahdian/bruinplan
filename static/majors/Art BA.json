As part of the upper-division advanced studio requirements, all undergraduate students are required to complete a senior studio course that emphasizes analysis and criticism of individual creative work and ideas. Students develop and present a body of creative work in which they exhibit familiarity with and competence in a range of techniques and media, and a level of proficiency in utilizing particular media appropriate to advanced-level studio projects. Graduates are expected to demonstrate familiarity with global historical precedents for and issues in contemporary art, to understand terms and concepts relevant to contemporary art discourse, and to have the ability to effectively articulate analysis of works of art to participate in a studio critique.",
