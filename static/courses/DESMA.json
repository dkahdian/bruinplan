Exploration of its conceptual, theoretical, and practical dimensions. From exploring sound perception, memory, and human orientation to embracing everyday auditory encounters, study delves into various approaches for crafting and showcasing sound-based media projects. Overview of sound art and sound design practices. Topics span from fundamental sound theory and acoustics to psychoacoustics, sound compositions, and spatial audio. Covers techniques such as editing and mixing to employ effects and automation. Includes areas such as field recordings, voice, and sound synthesis. Students gain honed listening skills and a robust theoretical framework, empowering them to articulate interests and creative visions through sound. Letter grading.",
