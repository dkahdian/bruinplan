  "name": "Mathematics for Teaching BS",
  "overview": "The Mathematics for Teaching major is designed primarily for students planning to teach mathematics at the high school level. It provides exposure to a broad range of mathematical topics, especially those appropriate for the prospective teacher. Students planning to pursue graduate studies in mathematics or related fields are encouraged to enter the Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, or Mathematics of Computation major.\nThe Mathematics for Teaching major is a designated capstone major. In their senior year, students complete a year-long course sequence that culminates in a model lesson presentation, paper, and portfolio. Through their capstone work, students demonstrate their familiarity with research and current issues in mathematics education, as well as their capacities to problem solve; reason quantitatively, geometrically, and algebraically; construct viable arguments; critique others\u2019 reasoning; and use tools strategically.",
