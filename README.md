# BruinPlan

A modern, interactive course planning tool for UCLA students â€” designed to provide a better alternative to the traditional DARS interface. This static site visualizes course requirements, prerequisites, and scheduling paths to make degree planning intuitive and personalized.

## Project Overview

UCLA's current Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS) provides dense, hard-to-interpret data. This project aims to reimagine that experience with a visual and interactive frontend tool that allows students to:

- View **required courses**, **electives**, and **degree progress** by major
- Explore **prerequisite trees** in an interactive graph
- Filter and sort courses by **department**, **availability**, **professor**, and more
- Track completed courses and see valid paths toward graduation
- Build quarter-by-quarter **course plans**
- View rich metadata:
  - Grading distributions (via UCLAGrades)
  - Professor reviews (via Bruinwalk)
  - Course availability and scheduling
