# Major Data Specification

## Overview
This document defines the JSON structure for major requirement data files. Major requirements are treated as "meta-courses" where all requirements are prerequisites to completing the major.

## File Structure

### Root Object
```json
{
  "name": "Mathematics BS",
  "overview": "Brief description of the major",
  "college": "College of Letters and Science",
  "department": "Mathematics", 
  "degreeLevel": "Undergraduate",
  "degreeObjective": "Bachelor of Science",
  "sections": [...]
}
```

### Section Object
Each major is divided into logical sections (e.g., "Preparation for the Major", "The Major", "Electives").

```json
{
  "id": "preparation",
  "title": "Preparation for the Major",
  "description": "Complete 10 courses as follows: Mathematics 31A or 31L, seven required courses, and two elective courses.",
  "requirements": [...]
}
```

### Requirement Types

#### Course Requirement
```json
{
  "type": "course",
  "courseId": "MATH 31A"
}
```

#### Group Requirement
```json
{
  "type": "group",
  "title": "Electives",
  "description": "Select two courses from:",
  "needs": 2,
  "options": [
    {"type": "course", "courseId": "CHEM 20A"},
    {"type": "course", "courseId": "CHEM 20B"}
  ]
}
```

#### Nested Groups (for optional tracks/concentrations)
```json
{
  "type": "group",
  "title": "Optional Specializations",
  "description": "Choose one specialization (optional)",
  "needs": 0,
  "options": [
    {
      "type": "group",
      "title": "Applied Mathematics Track",
      "description": "Complete all courses in this track",
      "needs": 3,
      "options": [
        {"type": "course", "courseId": "MATH 151A"},
        {"type": "course", "courseId": "MATH 151B"},
        {"type": "course", "courseId": "MATH 164"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Field Definitions

### Root Fields
- `name` (string): Full name of the major
- `overview` (string): Brief description of the major
- `college` (string): College within the university
- `department` (string): Academic department
- `degreeLevel` (string): "Undergraduate", "Graduate", etc.
- `degreeObjective` (string): "Bachelor of Science", "Master of Arts", etc.
- `sections` (array): Array of section objects

### Section Fields
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the section (not standardized across majors)
- `title` (string): Display name for the section
- `description` (string): Detailed description of section requirements
- `requirements` (array): Array of requirement objects

### Course Requirement Fields
- `type` (string): Always "course"
- `courseId` (string): Course identifier (foreign key to course database)

### Group Requirement Fields
- `type` (string): Always "group"
- `title` (string): Display name for the group
- `description` (string): Description of group requirements
- `needs` (number): Number of options required (0 for optional groups)
- `options` (array): Array of requirement objects (can be courses or nested groups)

## Extensibility

### Missing Prerequisites
Missing prerequisites are handled automatically by the TypeScript code and do not need to be included in the JSON data.

## Data Validation Rules

1. **Section IDs**: Must be unique within a major but not standardized across majors
2. **Group Logic**: `needs` value must be â‰¤ number of options in the group
3. **Nesting**: Groups can contain other groups (unlimited nesting depth supported)
4. **Required Fields**: All fields marked as required must be present and non-empty
5. **Missing data**: Some courses offer a range of courses to choose from rather than exact course numbers. In this case, please leave the options as an empty array, so it can be found and dealt with once the course data is fully loaded.
