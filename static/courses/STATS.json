They are very difficult to substantiate and often misleading. The data revolution makes various forms of association easier to discover, but in many cases does not help to affirm whether an observed association reflects the implied causal relationship. The larger datasets grow, the more easily non-causal associations can rise to the level of being noticed and mistakenly used as causal. Study builds conceptual and formal analytical skills required to evaluate causal claims through a focus on conceptual work and more technical analytic methods.
