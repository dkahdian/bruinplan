Requisites: Civil Engineering M20 or Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering M20 or Computer Science 31, Mathematics 32B, 33A. Overview of foundational data analysis and machine-learning methods in bioengineering, focusing on how these techniques can be applied to interpret experimental observations. Topics include probabilities, distributions, cross-validation, analysis of variance, reproducible computational workflows, dimensionality reduction, regression, hidden Markov models, and clustering. Students gain theoretical and practical knowledge of data analysis and machine-learning methods relevant to bioengineering. Application of these methods to experimental data from bioengineering studies. Students become sufficiently familiar with these techniques to design studies incorporating such analyses, execute analysis, and work in teams using similar approaches, and ensure correctness of their results.
