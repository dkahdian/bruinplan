Exploration of gender critically as highly plural, fluid, and intersectional phenomenon of social organization. As embodied arts existing in often liminal and highly-charged performing spaces and intertwined with pleasure, music and dance frequently foreground issues surrounding body, gender, and sexuality. While being spaces for performing of hegemonic gender identities they can reveal contradictions of normative gender identities (albeit not always intentionally or consciously), and they are also central part of many gender and sexual minority subcultures. Study of gender, performing arts, and power as inseparable, and as manifested in multiple forms of intersectionality, notably including race, class, and age. Letter grading.",
