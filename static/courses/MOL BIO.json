        "description": "Lecture, one hour; discussion, one hour. Two cornerstones of science advancement are rigor in designing and performing scientific research and ability to reproduce biomedical research findings. Applications of rigor ensures robust and unbiased experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results. When results can be reproduced by multiple scientists, it validates original results and readiness to progress to next phase of research. Scientific rigor is strict application of scientific method to ensure unbiased and well-controlled experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results. Covers literature and videos on rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research. Discussion of issues raised by lecture, or case-studies, with training program faculty. Students learn that reproducibility is common problem in biomedical research and how to improve it. S/U grading.",
