  "name": "Classical Civilization BA",
  "overview": "The civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome have made important contributions to the political, social, artistic, and intellectual development of the Western world. The purpose of the Classical Civilization major is to provide students with a formal and balanced introduction to the historical and cultural experiences of the ancient Greeks and Romans. The program of study is structured, yet not rigid. Lower-division survey courses and requirements in elementary language study, ancient history, and classical art establish an essential background of knowledge, while electives encourage individual and specialized interests. The program offers a broad range of courses in the fields of language, literature, history, mythology, religion, philosophy, art, and archaeology. The major serves as excellent and rewarding preparation for a professional career in medicine, law, business, journalism, communications, or the arts.",
